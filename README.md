# Hello there
So I'm creating a tools, not useful.\n 
But just for fun, it made with Lua script :D
So hopefully you can try, it is okay to modify the code for personal use.

> Download Lua: >
```
sudoapt-get install lua5.3
```

> Get the folder: >
```
git clone https://github.com/HamsChan/FictionCodespace
```
