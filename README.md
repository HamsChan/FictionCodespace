# Hello there
So I'm creating a tools, not useful.<br/> 
But just for fun, it made with Lua script :D<br/>
So hopefully you want to give it a try, it is okay to modify the code for personal use.

> Download Lua: 
```
sudo apt-get install lua5.3
```

> Get the folder: 
```
git clone https://github.com/HamsChan/FictionCodespace
```
